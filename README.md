# Nova-Nox-Neural-Network

## About

N4: Nova-Nox-Neural-Network is N4 is a mechanism designed to enhance accuracy by integrating the self-referential capabilities of the Attention mechanism with a simplified version of the selective copying architecture inspired by S6, thereby enabling the acquisition of a more expressive QK matrix. 

The architecture employs ASGG: Adaptive Swish-GELU Gating as the activation function within its MLP components, contributing to richer representational capacity. 

Furthermore, it utilizes DyT for normalization, which improves computational efficiency. 

This repository provides a simplified implementation of N4, and it can be readily integrated with recent Attention-based architectures such as SWA, GQA, and MLA.
