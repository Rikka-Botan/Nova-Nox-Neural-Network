## About

N4: Nova-Nox-Neural-Network is a mechanism designed to enhance model accuracy by integrating the self-referential capabilities of the Attention mechanism with a selective copying mechanism similar to that of S6, thereby enabling the acquisition of a more expressive QK matrix. 

The architecture employs ASGG as the activation function within the MLP, contributing to increased representational capacity. 

Additionally, DyT is used for normalization, improving computational efficiency.

This repository provides a simplified implementation of N4, which can be readily integrated with modern Attention architectures such as SWA, GQA, and MLA.
